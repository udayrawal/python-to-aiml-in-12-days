## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

I realized that watching tutorials is not the same as *owning* Python.

This repository is my **focused, time-bound execution plan** to:
- Build strong confidence in Python core concepts
- Stop fearing logic-based questions
- Prepare a solid foundation for **AI/ML internships**

## 🧠 What I’m Mastering (By 5 Feb)

### ✅ Core Python
- Functions (logic, return, reuse)
- Clean problem-solving mindset

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes & objects
- Inheritance & polymorphism
- Real-world mini systems

### ✅ NumPy
- Array-based thinking
- Mathematical operations
- Performance-oriented coding

### ✅ Pandas
- DataFrames & Series
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
